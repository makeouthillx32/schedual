        There are a wide variety of ways you can get involved with Desert Area Resources and Training â€“
        sponsoring events, volunteering your time, hosting a fundraiser, and more! 
        <br /><br />
        Desert Area Resources and Training is over 70% self-funded, and that means that every dollar 
        earned at one of our signature events goes directly into the programs and services for over 
        3,000 adults with disabilities we serve.
