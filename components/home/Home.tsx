          DART offers programs and services to people with and without developmental disabilities or other special
          needs. Our staff is here to provide services and opportunities to meet the needs of the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          After an initial referral from the State of California - Department of Developmental Services - Regional
          Center, young children who are found eligible are assessed and their plans are developed on an individual
          basis. Children in this program are offered specialized instruction and supports to aid with their
          development. The ratio of child to teacher is kept as low as 1-to-1, toddler and pre-school settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Children with developmental disabilities are provided with early intervention services to address their
          educational and social developmental milestones. Our Early Childhood Services teach children basic educational
          skills and social skills they need to prepare for attending school in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          For adults with developmental disabilities and other special needs, there are various programs and services
          offered such as Supported Employment, Work Activity Program and Supported Living Programming. We support
          adults on the job and special events annually and do collaborative community projects for adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the summer we host day camp for children with Autism and support advocacy for children, adults and
          families.

              Founded in the first Board of Directors - Officers of the IWV-ARC - in the center of the picture are Don
              and Louise Fowler, parents of Janie. At the right of the photo is Jean Backman and on the other side is
              Doris Bjornstad. Janie Fowler would become one of the first participants of the Desert Area Resources and
              Training program in 1979. Janie is still served today by DART over 30 years since their idea to run
              Activity on the Fair Grounds. In 1961, twenty parents of children with disabilities met and established
              the Indian Wells Valley Council for Retarded Children. The council developed a recreation program for
              preschoolers with disabilities, which continued until 1966.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The council also worked with the Kern County Superintendent of Schools and petitioned the Office of Kern
          County Superintendent of Schools to establish a special education class in the valley. Until then, there was
          no classes in the valley for students with mental or intellectual challenges, except for rare cases involving
          mild special needs. At that time, children under six or over sixteen years of age with developmental
          disabilities were not served by the public school system. Children with more severe disabilities or who were
          developmentally disabled were not cared until the early 1970's.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1962, the United Way of the Indian Wells Valley began their support of the organization; this support
          continues to the present day. The Sunshine House began in 1973 as a day care center for adults with
          developmental disabilities. In 1979, the Indian Wells Valley Association for Retarded Citizens changed its
          name Indian Wells Valley Council for Retarded Children and the Sunshine Activity Training Center merged to
          become the Indian Wells Valley Association for Retarded Citizens. Renamed Desert Area Resources and Training
          in 1991, the organization now provides a variety of programs and services to both children and adults.
          Expansion has continued over the years to include not only the Indian Wells Valley but the entire surrounding
          communities and concepts for the Inyo and Eastern communities in Inyo, Kern, Mono, and San Bernardino
          counties.
