        Desert Area Resources and Training is a non-profit organization that empowers people with
        intellectual and developmental disabilities and their loved ones. Our suite of tailored
        disability services focuses on enriching, empowering, and equipping those we serve to become
        job-ready, confident, and more independent. We help remove barriers preventing individuals
        from finding and keeping gainful employment and assist families in accessing quality
        support.
        <br />
        <br />
        The programs we offer have contributed to increasing the quality of life and reducing the
        chances of people with disabilities falling into homelessness and poverty. Over the last 70
        years, our positive impact on our community has been immeasurable. We are proud to have
        gained a reputation as one of the most respected and innovative nonprofit organizations in
        Ridgecrest.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have a range of disability services and donâ€™t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach.
