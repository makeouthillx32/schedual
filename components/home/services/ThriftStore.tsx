          This long established business of DART provides the home to our Work Activity Program,
          and five Supported Employment crews. All funded clients play an active role in all aspects
          of the running of the store. The sharing of responsibilities for duties of daily work and
          ownership of the departments within the store has given pride and accomplishment to these
          employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          This cooperative and inclusive work atmosphere is different than what you may find in other
          Work Activity Programs. All participants in this program are paid clients in training at DART.

          In the beginning the Thrift Store was all DART was about. We hope you will learn that although
          the store is very important to us – it is just part of the DART story. The biggest change in
          our store is the feeling of ownership the people who work there now have in their jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just stop by and you will see that there are only a small handful of “staff” who are in the
          wings of the operation. The profits from the store go right back into the business just as
          they have from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other aspect of the store is that we from time to time have short-term contracts that
          are achieved under this roof. If you should have a job that might lend itself to a small
          assembly line work – give us a call.
