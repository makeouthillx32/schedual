          Our trained, certified drivers pick up and then again take home our participants
          to our programs and services. We provide approximately 1300 miles of transportation
          daily to almost 180 people monthly.

          The second function of our fleet is contract support for Commercial Services crews,
          Landscaping crews, and Thrift Store trucks.

          You couldn’t do what we do without lots, and lots, and lots of vehicles.
          You don’t want our gas bill — do you? People are often surprised but then say —
          Oh yes — there goes that DART van again. We have a very wonderful fleet of
          beautiful vehicles. They role almost 365 days of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between our weekly contracts, and programs and the recreation activities and contracts,
          we are out of the vehicle compounds almost 24 hours a day.
